# Question

Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer

`\b` is more precise for matching entire words, while \s is more general for matching patterns separated by whitespace. `\b` is good for searching for specific words in a text and want to ensure they are standalone entities. While `\s` is good for matching patterns regardless of whether they are standalone words or part of a longer string.
