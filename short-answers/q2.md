# Question

What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer

RegEx makes the code cleaner so for example, instead of `if (a === a)` or `(a !== b)` multiple times, it's can all be done in a RegEx.

# Teacher Feedback

Yes! Regex will automatically check if there are specific letters and words in the string!
