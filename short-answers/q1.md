# Question
`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get *all* instances of a pattern?

# Answer
The `replace` function replaces only the first occurrence of a pattern by default. To replace all occurrences without `replaceAll`, add a global flag `//g`.

# Teacher Feedback

Yup! Remember that the `g` is a **flag** so it goes after the end of the pattern and there is no need for an extra `/` since you are not escaping a specific character!
